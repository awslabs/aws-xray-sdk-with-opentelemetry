 ## AWS X-Ray SDK w/ OpenTelemetry API

The purpose of this repository is to serve as the central location for the development of the AWS X-Ray SDK for Java that is compatible with the [OpenTelemetry API](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/master/api) currently under development. Our goal is to enable usage of both AWS X-Ray APIs and OpenTelemetry APIs within the same trace and enable usage of OpenTelemetry contrib integrations with AWS X-Ray. This enables open experimentation and sharing of ideas between these overlapping customer segments.

Currently, this is an 0.1.0-alpha and supports the 0.2.0-SNAPSHOT release of OpenTelemetry.

## Objective

Our goal is to address the following use cases on behalf of customers want to trace workloads:

* Enable workloads instrumented using OpenTelemetry APIs to send data to services such as AWS X-Ray and Amazon CloudWatch.
* Automate code instrumentation by making the use of agent frameworks such that developers no longer need to make manual code changes to instrument their applications.

## Roadmap

* Proof of concept showing the use of X-Ray and OpenTelemetry libraries for code instrumentation.
* Proof of concept showing the use of OpenTelemetry libraries with existing applications instrumented with the AWS X-Ray SDKs enabling support for a broader set of libraries (e.g.: memcached, etc.)
* <Add other PoC items addressed in demo>
* Alpha version of OpenTelemetry exporters for AWS X-Ray and Amazon CloudWatch
* Alpha version of instrumentation agent for Java.
